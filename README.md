# nap-iron-bird
aerospace system simulation infrastructure built with laptop and Maker-space components

This Repository contains planning information, and artifacts, in support of development of an "Iron Bird" simulation capability for aerospace systems.
 
This simulation capability will serve a growing community of aerospace professionals who will benefit from access to a test bed suitable for prototyping aerospace systems. Examples of possible applications include: drones, tethered or untethered dirigibles, and small sats in the Small Nano and Cube classifications. Systems of these types may be developed in pursuit of solutions solutions for existing problems in aerospace and for experimenting with possible new platforms to potentially serve a variety of civil, government, or private customers.
 
As currently envisioned this simulation will start from a laptop environment most likely running Linux or Robot Operating System (ROS/Gazebo).

Default programming language of choice will be Python 3.

The laptop in most cases will serve as the Command and Control, and User input central interface, for man-in-loop activities as required by CONOPS of the target system being developed.
 
Additional connectivity to Raspberry Pi computers via either ethernet or Wi-Fi connection.
 
Additional components as required by either mechanical systems of the platform infrastructure, and, or mission critical elements constituting payload elements will be achieved by a bus protocol, either I2C, or CAN bus.
 
Endpoint control of platform devices, or payload devices will be enabled most likely by smaller components such as Arduino, Feather, or Trinket microcontroller boards. all connected by the aforementioned bus architecture.
 
Development Methodology 
 
At the outset the formal process system modeling, function analysis, and ultimately requirements definition will be implemented. This will ensure that a robust, flexible, and grow-able system can be realized to achieve maximum capability with minimal wasted cost in terms of unnecessary hardware procurement, and or unnecessary software development.
 
It is essential as a primary requirement that this system be flexible and adaptable to support a wide range of possible applications.
 
Development Philosophy 
 
This approach will be greatly facilitated to the extent that it (may/will) cultivate input from a variety knowledgeable participants who have experience in Aerospace systems development and/or Maker-space styled simulation or robotics projects.
 
This depository will evolve mindful of the need to be clear and concise in order to best facilitate Collabera collaboration among contributors with varying experiences and skill levels.
 
This overall effort we'll also attempt to leverage quality open source resources such as videos produced and published on YouTube by the following contributor, to name just one:
